This project can be applied to an order with personal photos to recognize family members.
The project consists of two parts:

- Face detection and extraction
- Face recognition

## Face detection and extraction

Here we are using haarcascade method implemented in opencv to detect faces on an image, this is licensed under "Intel License Agreement For Open Source Computer Vision Library": (<https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml>)
